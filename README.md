## Overview

This project is a Maven-based web application developed to demonstrate [insert purpose or functionality]. It utilizes AWS for cloud deployment and Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to ensure efficient and reliable application delivery.

## Features

- **AWS Deployment:** The application is hosted on Amazon Web Services, leveraging its scalability and reliability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build, test, and deployment processes using Jenkins.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher:** [Download Link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **Apache Maven 3.6.0 or higher:** [Download Link](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **Git:** [Download Link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **AWS Account:** [Sign Up](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
- **Jenkins:** [Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHAIKSHOAIB-GIT/maven-web-application.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd maven-web-application

3. **Build the project using Maven:**
   ```bash
      mvn clean install

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
Replace with the appropriate command if not using Spring Boot.

Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/.

AWS Deployment
The application is deployed on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2 for hosting. Deployment is managed through Jenkins, ensuring seamless updates and scalability.

CI/CD Pipeline
A robust CI/CD pipeline is implemented using Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes:

Continuous Integration (CI):

Code Integration: Upon code commits to the GitHub repository, Jenkins triggers the build process.
Automated Testing: Executes unit and integration tests to validate code changes.
Continuous Deployment (CD):

Artifact Deployment: Successful builds are deployed to AWS EC2 instances.
Monitoring: Post-deployment monitoring ensures application stability.
This automation enhances development efficiency and reduces manual intervention, leading to faster release cycles.
